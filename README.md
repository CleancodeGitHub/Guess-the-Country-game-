I've created a polished Guess the Country game with the following features:

Beautiful UI with Tailwind CSS and Lucide React icons
High-quality country images from Unsplash
Hint system with multiple hints per country
Score tracking
Feedback for correct/incorrect answers
Game over screen with final score
Ability to restart the game
Responsive design that works on all screen sizes
The game includes:

A card-based interface showing country images
An input field for guesses
A hint system that reveals progressive hints
Score and round tracking
Immediate feedback on guesses
A final score screen with the option to play again
The code is organized into:

Type definitions for strong typing
Separate components for better maintainability
A countries data file that can be easily expanded
Clean, modern React patterns using hooks
The development server is now running and you can start playing the game. You can:

Enter your guess for each country
Use hints if you need help
See your score as you progress
Play again when you finish all rounds
